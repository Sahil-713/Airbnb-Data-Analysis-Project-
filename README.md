# 🏠 Airbnb Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data using **Python** and **Power BI** to uncover trends, identify market insights, and create visual storytelling through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

> This project is part of my data analytics journey where I explored over 100,000 Airbnb listings to identify:
- Which types of rooms are most common?
- How does price vary by neighborhood and room type?
- What trends are visible in reviews and availability over time?

<summary><strong>📊 Key Insights & Visualizations</strong></summary>

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values in key columns (`last review`, `house_rules`, etc.)
- Converted dollar amounts in `price` and `service fee` to numeric format

### 📈 Visual Insights
- **Room Types**: Entire homes/apts dominate the listing share, followed by private rooms
- **Price Distribution**: Most listings priced below average, with a few luxury outliers
- **Neighborhoods**: Manhattan & Brooklyn are most popular, Queens and Bronx less so
- **Reviews Over Time**: Periodic spikes and drops hint at external impacts like travel seasons
- **Price vs Room Type**: Hotel rooms are priced highest on average, followed by entire homes

## 🧠 What I Learned

✅ Cleaning large datasets with mixed datatypes  
✅ Handling missing values and outliers effectively  
✅ Visual storytelling using Seaborn & Power BI  
✅ Creating dynamic dashboards for non-technical users  
✅ How room types and geography influence Airbnb pricing and reviews  

---

## 📌 Outcome

- Developed a **cleaned dataset** ready for advanced analytics
- Created a **Power BI Dashboard** covering:
  - Room type distribution
  - Neighborhood popularity
  - Price vs room type
  - Reviews and availability trends
- Improved my EDA, data storytelling, and visualization skills
